Welcome to the Archetype Developer Kit, the public, community-backed standard for advanced theme design and development!

- üèòÔ∏è **Build together instead of in silos** - Stop building and maintaining your own tooling. We all benefit from collaborating on **how** to build themes. Save the competition for **what** we build.
- üòá **Simple and vanilla** - Stop working with compiled theme code. Stay as close to the platforms as possible. Devkit keeps things simple with minimal tooling magic. No bundlers. No compiled code. Use modern browsers to their full capabilities.
- üß± **Reusable theme components** - Build the pieces really well and reuse it in other places.
- üë∑ **Centralize and compound contributions over time** - Centralize your theme code and share it across theme projects. A clear interface between re-usable and project-specific code. Make it it easy to keep your themes up-to-date.
- ü§≤ **Better design handoffs** - A component design experience that matches
