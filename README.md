Welcome to the Archetype Developer Kit on GitHub. As Shopify increasingly targets enterprise merchants in a cost-conscious economic climate, the value of coding with Liquid has become clear. Yet, existing tools like Dawn, Shopify CLI, and the Shopify Dev Docs often fall short for advanced theme development teams. 

We're opening Archetype's Devkit, the same tools we use to build themes that power 100k+ Shopify stores, to serve the needs of the broader professional theme design and development community. 

By embracing open source, we aim to enhance collaboration and drive innovation across the Shopify theme development community. Dive in to see how the Archetype Developer Kit can streamline your workflow and elevate your theme development projects.

> [!NOTE]
> **This initial preview of the Archetype Devkit is a call to action for the community.** We invite you to bring your insights and experiences to help shape our collective approach to theme development. Your feedback is crucial as we refine our methodologies and collaborate to establish best practices that benefit us all, paving the way to our grand launch in September 2024.

### The value we're chasing

We're looking to help establish the community-backed standard for theme design and development, and provide the following value:

- üòá **Keep things vanilla** - Stop working with compiled theme code. Stay as close to the platforms as possible. Devkit keeps things simple with minimal tooling magic. No bundlers. No compiled code. Use modern browsers to their full capabilities.
- üèòÔ∏è **Build together instead of in silos** - Stop building and maintaining your own tooling. We all benefit from collaborating on **how** to build themes. Save the competition for **what** we build.
- üß± **Build high-quality, reusable components** - Build the pieces really well and reuse it in other places.
- üë∑ **Centralize and compound contributions over time** - Centralize your theme code and share it across theme projects. A clear interface between re-usable and project specific code. Make it it easy to keep your themes up-to-date.
- ü§≤ **Better designer handoffs** - A component design experience that matches
