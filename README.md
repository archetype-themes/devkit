> This initial preview of the Archetype Developer Kit is a call to action for the community. We invite you to bring your insights and experiences to help shape our collective approach to theme development. Your feedback is crucial as we refine our methodologies and collaborate to establish best practices that benefit us all, paving the way to our grand launch in September 2024.

Welcome to the Archetype Developer Kit on GitHub. As Shopify increasingly targets enterprise merchants in a cost-conscious economic climate, the value of coding with Liquid has become clear. Yet, existing tools like Dawn, Shopify CLI, and the Shopify Dev Docs often fall short for advanced theme development teams. 

We're opening Archetype's Devkit, the same tools we use to build themes that power 100k+ Shopify stores, to serve the needs of the broader professional theme design and development community. 

By embracing open source, we aim to enhance collaboration and drive innovation across the Shopify theme development community. Dive in to see how the Archetype Developer Kit can streamline your workflow and elevate your theme development projects.


## The value we're chasing

- Stop building and maintaining your own tooling
  - Start using a fully-featured, community vetted approach
- Stop working with compiled theme code
  - Start working with Archetype's source code
- Stop maintaining a catalogue of theme project code-bases
  - Start funnelling all your work into a shared common core
- Stop re-inventing the same old functionality, with inferior results
  - Start using tested, configurable, and reusable components that are live on 100,000s of stores
- Stop producing theme designs that break when handed off to developers
  - Start creating theme designs based on actual components
