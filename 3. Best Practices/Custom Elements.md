# Custom elements

Custom elements are the foundational blocks that 99% of e-commerce stores use under the hood. They're small pieces of functionality that make up the larger parts of a storefront that you can, most importantly, compose together.

The idea is that we're able build a set of HTML custom elements that we can leverage in all themes. You can have custom elements for anything reallyâ€”sliders, drawers, popups, etc. but these custom elements can also be much more granular, e.g. a [cart icon](https://github.com/archetype-themes/reference-components/blob/main/components/cart-icon/assets/component.cart-icon.js#L12-L15) that shows the number of products in a buyer's cart and updates when that number changes, or a product block that [listens for an event](https://github.com/archetype-themes/reference-components/blob/main/components/variant-sku/assets/component.variant-sku.js) whenever the variant is changed.

You can find more detailed information about custom elements on the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements).
