# Getting started with Devkit

Welcome to the Archetype Devkit Public Preview! 

As Shopify increasingly targets large + enterprise merchants in a cost-conscious economic climate, the value of building your Online Store with Liquid is clearer than ever. Yet, existing tools like Dawn, Shopify CLI, and the Shopify Dev Docs often fall short for advanced theme development teams. 

Archetype is opening up the same tools we use to build themes that power 1000s of Shopify stores, to serve the needs of the broader professional Shopify theme design and development community. 

With an open-source first approach, we aim to enhance collaboration and drive innovation across the Shopify theme development community. **No more solutioning in private silos.** 

We all win when we collectively pool our expertise into **how** we build themes. Save the competetion for **what** we build.

## Benefits of adopting devkit

The benefits of using the kit for Shopify theme design and development include:

- **Streamlined Development Process:** The kit provides developers with a catalogue of pre-built components and tools, allowing for faster and more efficient theme creation and customization.
- **High-Quality Code Standards:** Leveraging the kit ensures that the theme projects start with best practices in coding standards, which can lead to more reliable and maintainable codebases.
- **Community-Sourced Innovations:** By using a community-driven development kit, developers gain access to a broader range of innovative solutions and practices that have been vetted by experienced theme developers.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** The open-source nature of the kit encourages collaboration among developers, which can enhance learning and result in more creative and effective theme designs.
- **Consistency Across Projects:** The kit helps maintain consistency in design and functionality across different themes, which is particularly beneficial for agencies managing multiple client projects.
- **Future-Proofing Themes:** With ongoing updates and community contributions, using the kit helps ensure that themes are compatible with the latest Shopify features and e-commerce trends.
- **Easier Theme Updates:** Upgrading to the latest version is easy thanks to a clear interface between components and theme
- **Reduced Development Time and Costs:** By streamlining the theme development process and reducing the need for custom coding, the kit can significantly lower development time and costs.
