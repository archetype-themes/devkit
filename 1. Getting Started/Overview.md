# Getting Started > Overview

Welcome to the Archetype Devkit Public Preview! 

As Shopify increasingly targets enterprise merchants in a cost-conscious economic climate, the value of coding with Liquid (over going headless) has become clearer than ever. Yet, existing tools like Dawn, Shopify CLI, and the Shopify Dev Docs often fall short for advanced theme development teams. 

Archetype is opening up the same tools we use to build themes that power 100k+ Shopify stores, to serve the needs of the broader professional Shopify theme design and development community. 

With an open-source first approach, we aim to enhance collaboration and drive innovation across the Shopify theme development community. No more building in private silos. We all win when we collectively pool our expertise into **how** we build themes. Save the competetion for **what** we build.

## Target Audience

✅ Devkit is here to serve agencies, in-house development teams, and solo designers/developers and help them deliver and maintain high-quality custom theme projects better than ever before.

## Benefits of adopting devkit

The benefits of using the kit for Shopify theme design and development include:
