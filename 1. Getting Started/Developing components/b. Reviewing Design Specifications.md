# Reviewing design specifications

### Figma - Component playground preview in Dev Mode

First, you need to see if you have access to Dev Mode in the file you’re inspecting by toggling to Dev Mode at the top of the file or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift D. If you don't have access to Dev Mode, you’ll be inspecting in Design Mode. You can select if you have can edit or can view access to see how to inspect.

When selecting a component or instance in Dev Mode, you’ll see a component preview, a link to the main component, as well as any links to relevant documentation and designers notes.

### Inspecting Components

The component playground appears in the inspect panel when a component instance is selected. Use the playground to experiment with the component’s different properties without changing the actual design. To open the component playground in Dev Mode:

1. Select a component instance on the canvas.
2. Click Open in playground in the Inspect panel.
