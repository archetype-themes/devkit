# Developing theme components

A theme component is a discrete unit of code that typically includes HTML (or Liquid), CSS, and possibly JavaScript, designed to implement a particular feature within a Shopify theme.

## Overview

This document guides you through the steps required to make some enhancements to the ['block-title' component](https://github.com/archetype-themes/reference-components/blob/main/components/block-title/block-title.liquid), following its initial design phase. By walking through this practical enhancement, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of the component development process within the Archetype Developer Kit. Here’s what we’ll cover:

1. **Reviewing design specifications:** We’ll start by examining the finalized design specifications provided by the designer. This will ensure that the development aligns with the visual and functional requirements.

2. **Setting up the development environment:** Before diving into code, we'll set up a local development environment tailored for Shopify theme development. This includes configuring necessary tools and ensuring you have access to the existing 'block-title' component code.

3. **Code adjustments:** We will detail the steps to modify the existing 'block-title' component, focusing on integrating new features or adjustments as specified in the design.

4. **Writing tests:** After coding, we’ll demonstrate how to test the component across various scenarios and devices, including debugging techniques to resolve any issues that arise.

By the end of this document, you'll have a thorough understanding of how to effectively enhance an existing theme component, ensuring it meets both new and existing requirements while adhering to the Archetype Devekit's standards for quality and maintainability.
