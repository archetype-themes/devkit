## Overview

This document guides you through the steps required to make some enhancements to the ['block-title' component](https://github.com/archetype-themes/reference-components/blob/main/components/block-title/block-title.liquid), following its initial design phase. By walking through this practical enhancement, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of the component development process within the Archetype Developer Kit. Here’s what we’ll cover:

1. **Reviewing Design Specifications:** We’ll start by examining the finalized design specifications provided by the designer. This will ensure that the development aligns with the visual and functional requirements.

2. **Setting Up the Development Environment:** Before diving into code, we'll set up a local development environment tailored for Shopify theme development. This includes configuring necessary tools and ensuring you have access to the existing 'block-title' component code.

3. **Code Adjustments:** We will detail the steps to modify the existing 'block-title' component, focusing on integrating new features or adjustments as specified in the design.

4. **Incorporating Best Practices:** As we adjust the code, we’ll emphasize best practices for Liquid, CSS, and JavaScript to maintain high standards of code quality and performance.

5. **Testing and Debugging:** After coding, we’ll demonstrate how to test the component across various scenarios and devices, including debugging techniques to resolve any issues that arise.

6. **Documentation Updates:** We'll discuss updating the component's documentation to reflect changes and provide clear usage instructions for other developers and future reference.

7. **Committing Changes and Review:** Lastly, we’ll cover how to commit your changes to the version control system, prepare for code reviews, and merge enhancements back into the project repository.

By the end of this document, you'll have a thorough understanding of how to effectively enhance an existing theme component, ensuring it meets both new and existing requirements while adhering to the Archetype Developer Kit's standards for quality and maintainability.
