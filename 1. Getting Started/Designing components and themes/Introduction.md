The theme components and design system Figma file is the designer companion piece to the Archetype Devkit, providing a collection of components that together, create a basic online purchase flow.

This theming library is a demo, outlining how the complete library will be composed. It has been created as a consistent representation of what the styles, components, and sections that make up Devkit are capable of, and allows designers to work with these building blocks in order to design new themes/stores using Archetype's web components, and hand them off to developers.
