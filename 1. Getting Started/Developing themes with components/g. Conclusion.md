# Conclusion

We hope you enjoyed our getting started guide on "Developing Themes with Components"! This guide outlined the steps to building and styling a new theme with components, integrating design requirements, and deploying changes to a Shopify development store. Now that you've got the basics down, there's a lot more you can learn about how our approach to theme development can make your lives easier.

- [Design Tokens](https://github.com/archetype-themes/devkit/blob/main/2.%20Architecture/Design%20Tokens.md) and how they can be used to create a consistent design system
- [Component Slots](https://github.com/archetype-themes/devkit/blob/main/2.%20Architecture/Theme%20Components/Slots.md) and how they can be used to create modular components by inserting content into slots
- [Component Explorer](https://github.com/archetype-themes/devkit/blob/main/2.%20Architecture/The%20Component%20Explorer.md) to visualize, develop and test components in an isolated environment
- [Testing Components](https://github.com/archetype-themes/devkit/blob/main/2.%20Architecture/Theme%20Components/Tests.md) to ensure that components function correctly, minimizing the time spent troubleshooting and fixing bugs in the theme
