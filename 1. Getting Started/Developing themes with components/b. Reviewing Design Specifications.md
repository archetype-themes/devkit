# Reviewing design requirements

1. **Open Figma design specs**: review the [design requirements](https://www.figma.com/file/wfOE30Q8piyj5Q7zJhXI2o/Reference-Theme-Demo-V2) provided by the designer.
2. **Component adjustments**: Design is requesting new features such as displaying product vendor and SKUs below the product title.
3. **Customizations**: In addition, Design is requesting that we update the styles for the buy buttons and make the element containing the product details sticky. We'll tackle this in the Customizations chapter shortly.
