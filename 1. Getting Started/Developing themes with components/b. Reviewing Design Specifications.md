1. **Open Figma design specs**: review the design requirements provided by the designer.
2. **Component adjustments**: Design is requesting new features such as displaying product vendor and SKUs below the product title.
3. **Customizations**: In addition, Design is requesting that we update the styles for the buy buttons and make the element containing the product details sticky. We'll tackle this in the Customizations chapter shortly.
