# Reviewing design requirements

1. **Open Figma design specs**: review the [design requirements](https://www.figma.com/file/wfOE30Q8piyj5Q7zJhXI2o/Reference-Theme-Demo-V2) provided by the designer.
2. **Component adjustments**:
    - Navigate to the `main-product` section file in the `reference-theme` workspace to incorporate new features such as displaying product vendor and SKUs below the product title.
    - Update the schema within this file to include new settings for vendor and SKU display.
3. **Customizations**: In addition, Design is requesting that we update the styles for the buy buttons and make the element containing the product details sticky. We'll tackle this in the Customizations chapter shortly.
