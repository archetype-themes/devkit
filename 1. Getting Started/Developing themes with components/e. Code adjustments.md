# Code adjustments

Follow the steps in the [Components development guide](https://github.com/archetype-themes/devkit/blob/main/1.%20Getting%20Started/Developing%20components/d.%20Code%20adjustments.md#update-your-component) to make the necessary code adjustments to the `block-title` component.

## Previewing changes

- **Development store**: Your project's development store allows you to automatically preview any changes once they are pushed to the `getting-started-theme` branch.
- **Shopify CLI**: Deploy your work-in-progress changes to a development theme using Shopify CLI for instant previews.

## Committing and deploying changes

- **Commit changes**: `git commit -m "Adds support for vendor and SKU"`.
- **Update theme**: Run the install command again in the reference-theme workspace to update the theme with these changes.
- **Preview and adjust**: Visit the product template in the development store, click into the title block, and adjust the settings to hide/show the vendor and SKU.

This concludes our code adjustments. By following these steps, you ensure that your theme components are not only functional but also aligned with the latest design specifications and user requirements.
