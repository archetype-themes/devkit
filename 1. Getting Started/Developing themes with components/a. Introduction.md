# Developing Themes with Components

Welcome to the "Developing Themes with Components" guide. This resource is designed to help you streamline Shopify theme development using the Archetype Developer Kit, enhancing your projects with modular and reusable components.

Our approach, similar to working with Dawn, uses familiar tools and workflows, making it easy to integrate modern, component-based architecture. This method not only simplifies development and enriches customization but also facilitates easier theme updates across your theme catalogue, ensuring your themes remain adaptable and maintainable.

For more details about the architecture of themes built with components, check out [Introduction to Devkit Theme Architecture]().

## Overview

This document provides a step-by-step guide on developing Shopify themes using components from the Archetype Developer Kit, emphasizing integration and customization. Here’s what we’ll cover:

1. **Reviewing Design Specifications:** We begin by ensuring a thorough understanding of the theme's visual and functional requirements based on the provided design specifications.
2. **Setting Up the Development Environment:** This step involves configuring a development store for testing, setting up GitHub for version control and collaboration, along with any necessary additional tools and setups.
3. **Installing updated components:** We'll ensure that the latest version of the components, as produced from the Developing Components guide, is installed, which should align with the outputs committed to the main branch of our repository.
4. **Code Adjustments + Configuration**: This phase includes modifying component parameters to meet design specs, applying custom CSS and design token overrides, deciding when to expose parameters in the theme editor versus using static values, and integrating design presets and locales into the theme editor settings.
5. **Incorporating Best Practices:** We emphasize applying best coding practices throughout the development process to ensure high quality and maintainability.
6. **Committing Changes, Review, and Deployment:** Details on handling changes using GitHub, setting up branch previews for team review, and deploying the final theme to production are covered here.

By the end of this document, you will know how to integrate and customize components for Shopify theme development. You'll manage a development environment, adjust components to fit design specs, and implement best practices for robust themes. You'll also handle GitHub version control, review processes, and deploy your theme to a live Shopify store, ensuring your development skills meet current e-commerce standards.

The “Getting started” branches in our repositories ([getting-started-theme](https://github.com/archetype-themes/reference-theme/tree/getting-started-theme) in `reference-theme` and [getting-started-components](https://github.com/archetype-themes/reference-components/tree/getting-started-components) in `reference-components`) are designed to guide you through the initial setup and development of a new theme using our components.
