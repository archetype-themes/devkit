# Conclusion

We hope you enjoyed our getting started guide on "Developing Themes with Components"! This guide outlined the steps to building and styling a new theme with components, integrating design requirements, and deploying changes to a Shopify development store. Now that you've got the basics down, there's a lot more you can learn about how our approach to theme development can make your lives easier.

- [Component Slots](https://github.com/archetype-themes/devkit/blob/main/2.%20Architecture/Component%20Slots.md) and how they can be used to create flexible components
- [Component Explorer](https://github.com/archetype-themes/devkit/blob/main/2.%20Architecture/Component%20Explorer.md) to visualize and interact with components in isolation
- [Testing Components](https://github.com/archetype-themes/devkit/blob/main/2.%20Architecture/Component%20Tests.md) to ensure they're working as expected resulting in less time spent on fixing theme bugs
