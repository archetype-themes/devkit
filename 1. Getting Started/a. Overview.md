# Getting Started > Overview

Welcome to the Archetype Developer Kit on GitHub! As Shopify increasingly targets enterprise merchants in a cost-conscious economic climate, the value of coding with Liquid has become clear. Yet, existing tools like Dawn, Shopify CLI, and the Shopify Dev Docs often fall short for advanced theme development teams. 

We're opening Archetype's Devkit, the same tools we use to build themes that power 100k+ Shopify stores, to serve the needs of the broader professional theme design and development community. 

By embracing open source, we aim to enhance collaboration and drive innovation across the Shopify theme development community. Dive in to see how the Archetype Developer Kit can streamline your workflow and elevate your theme development projects.
